                <h2>missile men of india</h2>
                <p> <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in
                    the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the
                    State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;
                    his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                    forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four
                    brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                    landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group
                    found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
                    family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
                    Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the
                    Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and
                    properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by
                    the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager
                    income.
                    In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After
                    completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                    where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in
                    Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                    dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project
                    was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said
                    to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly
                    missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
                    eight positions were available in the IAF</p>
